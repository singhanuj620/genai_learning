# 🧠 Generative AI Playground

Welcome to my Generative AI learning journey!

This repository is a curated collection of small, hands-on projects I’ve built while diving into the world of Generative AI. From chatbots to AI agents, every project here is an experiment to explore, understand, and master this exciting space.

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I believe the best way to learn is by building. This repo is my sandbox — a place to tinker with ideas, test out frameworks, and implement cutting-edge concepts in Generative AI.

## 🧩 How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders, run the notebooks, or clone and tweak the code. Every project is kept as simple and readable as possible for learning purposes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/singhanuj620/genai_learning
cd genai_learning
```

1. Make sure to have some openAI credits in your account. [Click here to redirect to platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
2. Create an API key for your account [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
3. create a **.env** file in root folder
4. Paster the api key inside .env file as **OPENAPI_KEY=**
5. Navigate to the desired folder
6. Run the .py file and emjoyyy
